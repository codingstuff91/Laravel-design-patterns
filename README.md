## About this project

This project was made to practise and learn the main design patterns within a Laravel framework architecture

## Design patterns covered

Here are the design patterns covered into this project

- Strategy
- Builder
- Decorator
- Factory
- Manager

## How to test the design patterns

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Each design pattern can be tested with its own command available into the file `routes/console.php`.

These design patterns are explained with a basic example of the implementation of the solution provided by the design pattern. 

To test these examples you have to execute a artisan php command which is named accordingly to the design pattern name.

`php artisan builder`
